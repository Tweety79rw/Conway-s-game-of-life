using d3 and javascript created a Conway's game of life
# Welcome to the Conway-s-game-of-life wiki!

Four basic rules govern how this works 
   
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.  
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.  
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.  
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.  

The slide bar controls how fast the generations pass.

I believe the other buttons are self explanatory.
